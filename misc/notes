In azure create an account with the role to enable blob listing acces

azure.js changed fileInput to _fileInput [refactor]

create.html changed file-input to fileInput

server.js  created _fileInput=req.body.fileInput; [refactor]

server.js added if statement for (_fileURl) on post method 

blockBlobClient.url returns url of blob

moved azure.js inside server.js
document is not defined 
all html elements are now req.body (body-parser) methods inside express methods

we need to get the azure url into the server.js file
